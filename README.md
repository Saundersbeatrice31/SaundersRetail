# About this Application
In this demo you will find a fully configured basic webstore using Asp.Net MVC 5 n-tier application. The store is based around a fictitious fashion retailer called Saunders Retail which lists a variety of clothing itmems for sale.  The featured products have multiple pricing options, variant nodes are used to provide buying options for those particular product choices.

The site also showcases a basic shopping cart setup with cart management. Additionally, there are three main user roles that have different access to parts of the application.  The Super admin role has access to the entire application including creating additional roles.
